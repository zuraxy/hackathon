# Pedal Map - Intelligent Cycling Routes

Pedal Map is an innovative cycling route planner app created by DLSU students for the HackerCup hackathon. Think of it as "Waze but for Strava" - providing intelligent route planning specifically designed for cyclists.

## 🚲 Features

- **Bike-Specific Routes**: Optimized routes based on bike type (road, mountain, regular, electric)
- **Real-Time Hazard Reporting**: Community-powered hazard reporting system
- **Dynamic Route Adjustments**: Automatic route recalculation based on reported hazards
- **Interactive Map Interface**: Built with Leaflet and Geoapify

## 💡 Project Concept

While apps like Strava and Google Maps provide cycling directions, they don't offer the real-time hazard reporting and route adjustment that drivers enjoy with apps like Waze. Pedal Map fills this gap by creating a cycling-specific navigation platform that prioritizes safety and optimal routing based on the specific type of bicycle being used.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **Mapping**: Leaflet with Geoapify map tiles
- **Routing**: Geoapify Routing API
- **Styling**: Custom-themed UI components

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

3. Use the Expo Go app or emulator to view the application

## 🔑 API Keys

The app uses the Geoapify API for mapping and routing functionality. The current API key is included for demonstration purposes.

## 📱 App Workflow

1. Plan your route by selecting source, destination and bike type
2. View the optimal route on the map
3. Report hazards you encounter along the way
4. Benefit from automatic route recalculations when hazards are reported

## 🏆 HackerCup Hackathon

This project was created for the HackerCup hackathon by 2nd year students from De La Salle University. Our vision is to create a platform that could potentially be acquired by Strava or similar services to enhance the cycling experience worldwide.
